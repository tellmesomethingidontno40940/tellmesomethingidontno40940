- 👋 Hi, I’m @tellmesomethingidontno40940
- 👀 I’m interested in protecting the homeland both domestic &  internationally. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cyber security and anonymity online &  offline. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fighting those that plot to attack and destroy us & those cowards that radicalise others that are too afraid to strap on a vest themselves. 

- 📫 you can contact me threw pixelknot
